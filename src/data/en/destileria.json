A rock of over three hundred tons that balanced on the top of the hill, defying gravity and astonishing those who came to see it. For the people of Tandil and for visitors from afar, the Movediza Stone was a symbol of identity, encounter and roots.\n\nIn 1912 the stone fell, but its legend lived on. At Magic Stone we honor that story with every drop we distill: with technique, time and human judgment. Our spirits are born in Tandil and carry in every bottle the spirit of encounter that the great stone once represented.",
